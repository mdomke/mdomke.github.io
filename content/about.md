## Hej :wave:

I’m Martin. I’m working as a Tech Lead at [Qwist][1]. I’m interested in programming languages and
distributed systems. I currently build services in [Golang][2] and [Python][3], deploying them to
[Kubernetes][4]. I have worked in several industries ranging from automotive, aerospace, security
appliances, and e-commerce to FinTech.

I’m living in Eutin, a small town north of Hamburg, in Germany.
