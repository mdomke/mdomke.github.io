## Hej :wave:

I’m Martin. I’m working as a Tech Lead at [Qwist](https://qwist.com/).
I’m interested in programming languages and distributed systems.
I currently build services in [Golang](https://go.dev/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/),
deploying them to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
I have worked in several industries ranging from automotive, aerospace, security appliances,
and e-commerce to FinTech.

I’m living in Eutin, a small town north of Hamburg, in Germany.
