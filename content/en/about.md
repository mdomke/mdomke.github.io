## Hej :wave:

I'm Martin. I'm working as a Tech Lead at [finleap connect][1]. I'm interested in programming
languages and distributed systems. I currently build services in [Golang][2] and [Python][3],
deploying them to [Kubernetes][4]. I have worked in several industries ranging from automotive,
aerospace, security appliances, and e-commerce to FinTech.

I'm living in Eutin, a small town north of Hamburg, in Germany.
