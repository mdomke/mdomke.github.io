## Hej :wave:

I'm Martin. I'm working as a Tech Lead at [finleap connect](https://connect.finleap.com). I'm interested
in programming languages and distributed systems. I currently build services in Go and Python, deploying
them to Kubernetes. I have worked in several industries ranging from automotive, aerospace, security appliances,
and e-commerce to FinTech.
