There are some open source projects that I maintain

* [schwifty](https://github.com/mdomke/schwifty) is a Python library for working with IBANs and BICs
* [python-ulid](https://github.com/mdomke/python-ulid) is a Python implementation of the universally unique lexicographically sortable identifier ULID.
* [git-semver](https://github.com/mdomke/git-semver) allows you to automatically derive a SemVer compliant version number from git tags.
